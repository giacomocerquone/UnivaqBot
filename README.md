## Univaq Bot - Faculty of Computer Science

This is an **unofficial** [telegram bot](https://telegram.org/blog/bot-revolution), for the [University of L'Aquila](http://univaq.it).

We built it to provide a single and simple source of information for students of University of L'Aquila, in particular for the faculty of Computer Science (aka [disim](http://www.disim.univaq.it)).

All information is acquired, scraped, parsed, stored and synchronised using a bunch of Python scripts.
